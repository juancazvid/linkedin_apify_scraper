## üõ°Ô∏è Anti-Detection Tips

1. **Use Cookies Instead of Login**: Reduces detection risk
2. **Enable Proxy**: Always use `useProxy: true` for production
3. **Limit Concurrent Runs**: Don't run multiple instances simultaneously
4. **Respect Rate Limits**: Add delays between large batches
5. **Rotate Accounts**: Use different LinkedIn accounts for large-scale scraping
6. **Keep Sessions Short**: Limit to 100-200 profiles per session

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Legal Compliance
- Respect LinkedIn's Terms of Service
- Only scrape publicly available information
- Don't use scraped data for spamming or harassment
- Comply with GDPR and data protection laws

### Rate Limiting
- LinkedIn may temporarily restrict accounts that scrape too aggressively
- Recommended: Max 100 profiles per hour
- Use delays between requests for safety

### Data Freshness
- Profile data may be cached by LinkedIn
- Some information requires being logged in to view
- Connection/contact scraping requires 1st-degree connections

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Authentication Failed
- Verify email/password are correct
- Check if cookie has expired (cookies typically last 1 year)
- Try logging in manually first to handle any security checks

### No Data Returned
- Ensure URLs are valid LinkedIn URLs
- Check if profile/page is public or requires connection
- Verify authentication is working

### Rate Limited
- Reduce scraping speed
- Use longer delays between requests
- Try different proxy locations
- Switch to a different LinkedIn account

### Missing Data Fields
- Some fields only visible to connections
- Company employee counts require login
- Job applicant counts may be hidden

## üö¶ Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Test with 5-10 URLs first
2. **Monitor Performance**: Check logs for errors
3. **Handle Failures**: Implement retry logic for failed URLs
4. **Export Regularly**: Download data incrementally
5. **Validate Output**: Check data completeness
6. **Respect Privacy**: Don't scrape private/sensitive information

## üìä Performance

- **Average Speed**: 5-10 seconds per profile
- **Memory Usage**: ~500MB per browser instance
- **Success Rate**: 95%+ with proper configuration
- **Proxy Recommended**: Yes, for production use

## ü§ù Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the actor logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify your authentication is working
3. Test with a single URL first
4. Review the anti-detection tips above
